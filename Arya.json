Due to her parents’ recommendation, she transferred to Seirei Educational Institute, a prestigious school that is considered to be one of the best in Japan. If it is here, perhaps there could be someone who could compete shoulder￾to-shoulder with her and at the same time, someone who could accompany her in her devotion of study. This let her have faint expectations.\nHowever, Alisa’s faint expectations was cruelly crushed when she took a proficiency\ntest right after transferring, scoring first place in her school year after being away\nfrom Japan for 5 years.
